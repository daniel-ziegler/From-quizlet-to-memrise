Using flashcard is not very helpful as Memrise service is much better.

The issue with Memrise is that the smartest option is to create your own course.

The easiest way to create a course is through the bulk add option.

The bulk add option requires four columns, while exporting from Cram or Quizlet you receive only two.
#What the script does?
- Fills with empty spaces the extra columns Memrise expects.
- Allows the user to select which words to export
#Instruction for the end user
- Copy to your clipboard an export of a flash card set from Cram or Quizlet. Use comma "," as word separator and semicolon ";" as line separator.
- Paste from clipboard to the left text area.
- Click on "Confirm import" button
- Make a selection of which words you want to export
- At any time you can take the content of the right text area and use it with Memrise bulk add option.
